# Problem
- Finding the parity of a binary word
- word is 64 bits long
- Odd number of ones means that the parity is 1
- Even number of ones means that the parity is 0

## Brute Force Solution
The Brute force solutio iterates over every bit within the nubmer keeping track of the ones seen so far in the solution.

EPI Solution:
```python

def parity(x: int) -> int:
	result = 0
	
	while x:
		result ^= x & 1 # result = result ^ (x & 1) 
		x >>= 1 # right shift x once to remove the rightmost digit
		
	return result
```
This solution is an `O(n)` runtime

There are some imporvements we can make to this solution however.

- Using the fact that  `x & (x-1)` is equal to x with the first one bit erased we can reduce this to a time-complexity that is `O(k)` where k is the number of 1's within the word
- Use caching to split the 64 bit word into 4 16 bit words. We can compute the parity of ALL 16 bit words in `2^16` space. Then we can simply look
