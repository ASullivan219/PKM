# Problem
- Finding the parity of a binary word
- word is 64 bits long
- Odd number of ones means that the parity is 1
- Even number of ones means that the parity is 0

## Brute Force Solution
The Brute force solutio iterates over every bit within the nubmer keeping track of the ones seen so far in the solution.

EPI Solution:
```python

def parity(x: int) -> int:
	result = 0
	
	while x:
		result ^= x & 1 # exclusive or 
		x >>= 1
