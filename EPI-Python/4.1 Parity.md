# Problem
- Finding the parity of a binary word
- word is 64 bits long
- Odd number of ones means that the parity is 1
- Even number of ones means that the parity is 0

## Brute Force Solution
The Brute force solutio iterates over every bit within the nubmer keeping track of the ones seen so far in the solution.

EPI Solution:
```python

def parity(x: int) -> int:
	result = 0
	
	while x:
		result ^= x & 1 # result = result ^ (x & 1) 
		x >>= 1 # right shift x once to remove the rightmost digit
		
	return result
```
This solution is an `O(n)` runtime

There are some imporvements we can make to this solution however.

- Using the fact that  `x & (x-1)` is equal to x with the first one bit erased we can reduce this to a time-complexity that is `O(k)` where k is the number of 1's within the word
- Use caching to split the 64 bit word into 4 16 bit words. We can compute the parity of ALL 16 bit words in `2^16` space. Then we can find the parity of each of the 4 sections using our look-up table. Reduces the time complexity to `O(N/L)` where `N` is the number of bits in the word and `L` is the number of bits used to construct the lookup table. Take an example using an 8 bit word split into 4 2 bit sections

```
Lookup Table

[00] -> 0
[01] -> 1
[10] -> 1
[11] -> 0

Take the following Word: 
11011111
Split into 4 sections: 
[11][01][11][11]
Compute the parity of each section with our lookup table:
0,1,0,0

XOR these values: 1 parity
```

- Using properties of `XOR` you can find an optimal solution:
	- The parity of `< b63, b62 ... b0>` is equal to the parity of `< b63, ... ,b32>` XOR `< b31, ... ,b0>`

##  Optimal Solution from EPI

```python

def parity(x:int) -> int:
	x ^= x >> 32
	x ^= x >> 16
	x ^= x >> 8
	x ^= x >> 4
	x ^= x >> 2
	x ^= x >> 1
	
	return x & 0x1
```

Time Complexity: `O(log n)`
